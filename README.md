# Weather Dashboard

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

    the UV index is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

THEN that city is added to the search history

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
